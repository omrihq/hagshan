All code in this repo is throwaway. The code doesn't reflect any of my "regular" production code, and is riddled with inside jokes (literally code inside-jokes) and is meant to be in jest. I'm making it public in order to make a github page. If you've somehow stumbled upon this repo, welcome and enjoy. 

Happy Birthday Yonatan Zelnik, I love you with all my heart
